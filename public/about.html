<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone my names Scott, currently working as a delivery driver but aspiring for a career change in web developing, who has begun this journey through none other than the reputably acclaimed udemy website.</p>

<p>I began this journey at a later stage of my life due to personal circumstances and an uncertainty and constant search for many years, on what subject I was deeply passionate about, so I could commit some quality time to it for a more enjoyable and successful career.
This was due to a lack of drive and desire in the past due to my mental health struggles, trying to find myself and an instability in work, social life and many other aspects of everyday life that I'm sure a lot of us can relate to.</p>

<p>On my days off work I love to keep active by skateboarding (been doing it since young and still passionate about it to this day), going to the gym (to keep fit and healthy), outdoor running & hiking, playing video games and of course my revived interest in Computer Science (Web Developing). </p>
<p>I am now due to turn my life and career around and as Computer Science has always been very interesting to me since my early school days, this is the path I hope to stay on course with and excel high in amongst this subject. </p>
<p>Thank you for hearing me out folks, I wish all of you reading this nothing but the best, goodbye for now :)</p>
